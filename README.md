# - **Latest News** -
### **Update Released! (2023/12/05)**  
Cursor Changer 1.13β5 has been released!
This update fixes quite a variety of bugs and glitches.
In addition, four major new features have been added.
Please see the changelog at the bottom or in the release tab for more details.

&nbsp;

## - **ABOUT THIS BATCH** -
Cursor Chenger was created almost batch only, and No additional files or components are required.  
Im are pursuing what can be done with BATCH processing and etc.

This Batch is similar to a *simplified OS*, if you will.
At the very least, it is by far larger and more complex than the Batch around the corner. And I (**tamago1908**) **created all of them by myself.**

Simply put, it would be a single, working batchOS that aims to surpass the quality of all batchOS that have been created to date (like [Debios](https://github.com/debios/debios)😈) It would not be created strictly for the purpose of an OS, but it would come close. Also, unlike other batchOS, this will run in a single batch (If I may say so, it would be better to have an internet connection, but not essential.)  
And it have changes the color of the Windows cursor Function (the cursor you are currently moving rn). Not Cmd one. In addition to that, Cursor Changer haves various functions. At first glance, it may be difficult to understand what kind of batch it is, but it has the OS-like functions, and changing the cursor in Windows. In other words, it may be like Cursor Changer OS.

If you need any other backstory or detailed explanations, please visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/tamago1908/Cursor-Changer.bat/wiki).

>  Incidentally, it is in no way related to the Real [Cursor Changer](https://github.com/L413/Cursor-Changer), and the name match is coincidental. However, I feel there are some similarities in concept...

## - **HOW TO USE THIS BAT** -
To use Cursor Changer, you must first set it up. Here is the procedure.  

1 : Download the latest version from "Release" on Github. The following image shows a concrete example.  
![Cursor Changer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tamago1908/Cursor-Changer.bat/main/resource/Cursor%20Changer%20Github%20instruction%201.png)  
1.5 : Download it at here.  
![Cursor Changer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tamago1908/Cursor-Changer.bat/main/resource/Cursor%20Changer%20Github%20instruction%202.png)  
2 : After downloading, either run it as is or move it to your desktop and run it.  
3 : Wait a few seconds, and the first setup will start automatically. Follow the instructions. At that time, you will be asked to confirm precautions and settings, themes, etc.  
4 : Once setup is complete, you are then free to use the Cursor Changer. All functions in the menu after startup are available.  

You can change the cursor, use the calculator, check for updates, or even find Easter eggs.
however, that the current version has fewer features and is not perfect. If you want games or further OS-scale features, please wait for updates or report them in an issue.

## - **SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS** -
**This batch works only with** ***Windows 10 1511 or later***. **it will not work on earlier versions!** The reason is the special character code coloring and the fact that this batch contains features that do not work in the old powershell.
and if you want run with good performance, you should Prepare good pc.

At a minimum, you will need a CPU that can run some windows 10. (100 or higher In CineBench R15).
Recommended requirements are 2 cores 4 threads, 2.0 Ghz and higher. (230 or higher in CineBench R15)

Basically, the higher the better but too high performance may worsen the appearance of some animations (because the code executes too fast)

Also, in some environments, batch startup speed, etc., may be significantly reduced, but this is due to powershell.  
Since this BATCH performs processing using powershell at startup, if powershell startup is slow, startup will inevitably be slow as well.  
The solution is to set powershell as an exception in the anti-virus software you are currently using, which will usually solve the problem.  
Or, your device is simply too slow.  

In addition, the UI within Cursor Changer may collapse in rare cases, usually due to improper font widths, etc. Please set the font width that does not collapse and try again.
If it still collapses, please change the resolution or report it in an issue.  


## - **FREATURES** -
The most important feature is the ability to change the cursor. You can change it to white (windows default) or black. It also has a settings menu that allows you to change the behavior of Cursor Changer, a calculator, various easter eggs, hidden functions, advanced behavior using powershell, and much more. And best of all, all of these features are built with only a single BATCH file, no additional files are required!  

And this BATCH is still under development, with new new features and patches to come! (at least as long as the developers are motivated)  
and the most recent report (Latest News) is given at least once a month.  
At least as far as I have searched, almost all Batch OS have stopped updating in the last year.  
~~No update and No news for 1 years over? That's pathetic lol.~~  

### ***In creating this BATCH, I were inspired by the following.***
 
- *[Tobyfox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toby_Fox) (Undertale and Deltarune)*

- *[BSOD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_screen_of_death) (Blue screan of death)*

- *[Debios](https://github.com/debios/debios) (Batch OS)*

- *[KByteOS](https://github.com/SesatGuy/KBytesOS) (Batch OS)*

- *[Battles of Batch](https://github.com/136MasterNR/Battles-of-Batch) (Batch Project)*

- *[SAO](https://swordartonline.fandom.com/wiki/Sword_Art_Online_Wiki) (Japan Anime, Sword Art Online)*

## - **PRECAUTIONS** -
This batch generates several new files. The details are explained in the batch process, but two main files are generated: a configuration file and a txt file used to determine initial startup.

The configuration file and a txt file used to determine initial startup.
No other files are generated.

There is no modification of the files except by user operation. In other words, files are not and will not be modified unless operated on by the user.

Deletion of the BATCH process should be done from the uninstall menu that exists inside BATCH.
Manual deletion can be done by deleting the configuration file and the file for determining initial startup.

If you want to go to the path where those files exist, you can access them from the uninstall menu accessible from batch.
Then delete the BATCH process.
