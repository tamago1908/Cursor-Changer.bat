# 📰 - **Latest News** -
### **Update released! (2024/11/18)**  
1.15β2 (1.15.b2) has been released!  
This update includes several functional improvements and additions!  
See the Change log for detailed changes.  

&nbsp;
## 💡 - **About this batch** -
Cursor Chager is a project that tries to explore what can be done with batch and powershell, and is as OS-like functionally running on a single batch file!
At the very least, it is by far larger and more complex than the other Batch Projects. And I (**tamago1908**) **created all of them by myself.**  
In other word, Cursor Changer.bat is a combination of Real Cursor Changer and Batch OS! (However, it is not strictly a Batch OS. It is more like a Utility tool)  

and also, This Cursor Changer is a batch that has been in **development since 2021 and is still being developed over three years later**.  
It is probably one of the longest developing Batch project in the world. Moreover, development is scheduled to continue in the future.  

If you need any other backstory or detailed explanations, please visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/tamago1908/Cursor-Changer.bat/wiki).

>  Incidentally, it is in no way related to the Real [Cursor Changer](https://github.com/L413/Cursor-Changer), and the name match is coincidental. However, I feel there are some similarities in concept...

## 🔎	 - **Features** -
Cursor Changer features include changing cursors, updates, calculators, settings, uninstalls, launches, OOBEs, and various other functions and Easter eggs.  
Although there are only a few features at this time, but this BATCH is still under development, so new new features and patches to come! (at least as long as the developers are motivated)  
Cursor Changer is written primarily in Batch and Powershell, with Batch being the primary language, and Powershell being used for functions that are difficult to do with Batch alone (like Msgbox, updates, playing music, disabling the maximize button, settings, etcs...)  
In addition, Cursor Changer does not generate any temp files. (except for settings file and those generated by powershell)  
Cursor Changer might be considered a pure batch project, but that's not entirely accurate. Some other batch projects utilize vbs, exe files, or .DLLs. Instead of using those, Cursor Changer makes use of PowerShell.  
If projects that use such files are also referred to as pure batch, then Cursor Changer could be considered pure batch as well.  



and the most recent report (Latest News) is given at least once a month.  
At least as far as I have searched, almost all Batch OS have stopped updating in the last year.  
~~No update and No news for 1 years over? That's pathetic lol.~~  

### ***In creating this BATCH, I were inspired by the following.***
