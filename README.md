# ***! WANING !***
**FIRST OF ALL, AT LEAST NOW IS STILL** ***NOT SUPPORT ANOTHER LANGUAGE*** (like english)

**SO THIS BATCH IS** ***SUPPORT ONLY JAPANESE*** **AT LEAST NOW!!**

**IF YOU WANT USE THIS BATCH WITH ENGLISH, WAIT UPDATE!**

Cursor Chenger is currently in the beta version of 1.12.
Once the beta version is finished, it will officially be 1.12.
The 1.12 version will be translated into English. (Of course, there will be many other changes as well.)

## - **WHAT IS THIS?** -
Cursor Chenger was created entirely with batch only.
Im are pursuing what can be done with BATCH processing etc.

This Batch is similar to a *simplified OS*, if you will.
At the very least, it is by far larger and more complex than the Batch around the corner. And I (**tamago1908**) **created all of them by myself.**

`However, if you ask me why You make it, to tell the truth, I don't know either lol.`

## - **SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS** -
**This batch works only with** ***Windows 10 1511 or later***. **it will not work on earlier versions!** The reason is the special character code coloring and the fact that this batch contains features that do not work in the old powershell.
and if you want run with good performance, you should Prepare good pc.

At a minimum, you will need a CPU that can run some windows 10. (100 or higher In CineBench R15).
Recommended requirements are 2 cores 4 threads, 2.0 Ghz and higher. (230 or higher in CineBench R15)

Basically, the higher the better but too high performance may worsen the appearance of some animations (because the code executes too fast)

## - **FREATURES** -
Ability to change cursors, brand new CUI-based UI, tons of easter eggs, implement features in ways never done before, change themes, etc.
and much more!

## - **HOW TO USE THIS BAT** -
Download batch file, and just click "**Cursor chenger 1.12.bat**".
then have fun!

## - **PRECAUTIONS** -
This batch generates several new files. The details are explained in the batch process, but two main files are generated: a configuration file and a txt file used to determine initial startup.

The configuration file and a txt file used to determine initial startup.
No other files are generated.

There is no modification of the files except by user operation. In other words, files are not and will not be modified unless operated on by the user.

Deletion of the BATCH process should be done from the uninstall menu that exists inside BATCH.
Manual deletion can be done by deleting the configuration file and the file for determining initial startup.

If you want to go to the path where those files exist, you can access them from the uninstall menu accessible from batch.
Then delete the BATCH process.
