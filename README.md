# 📰 - **Latest News** -
### **Update released! (2025/03/25)**  
**Cursor Changer 1.15 has been released!**  
This update includes fixes and improvements! also, it's stable now!  
Check the change log for more details.  


&nbsp;
## 💡 - **About this batch** -
Cursor Chager is a project that tries to explore what can be done with batch and powershell, and is as OS-like functionally running on a single batch file!
At the very least, it is by far larger and more complex than the other Batch Projects. And I (**tamago1908**) **created all of them by myself.**  
In other word, Cursor Changer.bat is a combination of Real Cursor Changer and Batch OS! (However, it is not strictly a Batch OS. It is more like a Utility tool)  

and also, This Cursor Changer is a batch that has been in **development since 2021 and is still being developed over three years later**.  
It is probably one of the longest developing Batch project in the world. Moreover, development is scheduled to continue in the future.  

If you need any other backstory or detailed explanations, please visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/tamago1908/Cursor-Changer.bat/wiki).

>  Incidentally, it is in no way related to the Real [Cursor Changer](https://github.com/L413/Cursor-Changer), and the name match is coincidental. However, I feel there are some similarities in concept...

Main manu looks like This :

&nbsp;  


## 🔎	 - **Features** -
Cursor Changer features include changing cursors, updates, calculators, settings, uninstalls, launches, OOBEs, and various other functions and Easter eggs.  
Although there are only a few features at this time, but this BATCH is still under development, so new new features and patches to come! (at least as long as the developers are motivated)  
Cursor Changer is written primarily in Batch and Powershell, with Batch being the primary language, and Powershell being used for functions that are difficult to do with Batch alone (like Msgbox, updates, playing music, disabling the maximize button, settings, etcs...)  
In addition, Cursor Changer does not generate any temp files. (except for settings file and those generated by powershell)  
Cursor Changer might be considered a pure batch project, but that's not entirely accurate. Some other batch projects utilize vbs, exe files, or .DLLs. Instead of using those, Cursor Changer makes use of PowerShell.  
If projects that use such files are also referred to as pure batch, then Cursor Changer could be considered pure batch as well.  



and the most recent report (Latest News) is given at least once a month.  
At least as far as I have searched, almost all Batch OS have stopped updating in the last year.  
~~No update and No news for 1 years over? That's pathetic lol.~~

### - 1.15β5 build 150 (Beta Update, I'M NOT GONNA STOP DEVELOPPING THIS BATCH!!!)  

#### Added :  
- **New version info UI!**
  - (This new version info UI now also displays Your name and has a more refined design!)  
- **Reinstall cursor changer function has been added to the Recovery menu!**
  - (This function downloads the latest Cursor Changer via the Cursor Changer repository and directly replaces itself!)  

#### Changed :
- **All GUI processing now uses a `for` loop, including OOBE (except for `:cursorchange`)!**
  - (It's way faster now!)
- **OOBEMusic has been improved!**
  - (OOBEMusic now plays music in a separate process after downloading it in the Cursor Changer window. This makes the experience much smoother!)  
- BufferSize change is integrated into `:Core_PowerShell`  
- PowerShell check now uses the `where` command
  - (Faster and safer powershell check!)   
- `:Core_PowerShell` is slightly improved  
- OOBE's header/underbar drawer is integrated into `:OOBE_Drawer` (2x faster!)
  - (it was slow because it had to be called twice in Header_Drawer and Underbar_Drawer, but it is now faster because they are combined into one!)  
- OOBE Animation now uses a `for` loop (way faster)
  - (The animation used to be very slow because of `goto`, but now it is much more stable and fast!)  
- `:OOBEmain4` is slightly changed  
- `:OOBEmainblank` is slightly improved  
- Checking administrative privileges now uses `icacls.exe` instead of `cacls.exe`  
- Default boot animation processing is slightly improved  
- Typos warning is now much shorter
  - (Better `if` statements!)  
- Some UI elements are slightly changed or improved  
- Some unnecessary code has been deleted  

#### Fixed :
- Boot message bug fixed  
- Call error handler bug fixed  
  - (Since the call error handler bug was fixed, the "check update at boot" feature is also fixed at the same time!)  
- Some bugs have been fixed  

> This is the first update of 2025!  
> This update reduces the number of lines of code by an additional 300 lines, making it 10KB lighter.
> (About 5100 lines, and 300KB)  
> If you find a bug or a glitch, please report it in an issue.

### - 1.15β4 build 131 (Beta Update, 2024 LAST UPDATE!!!)  

#### Changed : 
- **Cursor backup feature is added!!**  
  -  Cursors can now be backed up! The registry values where the cursor settings are stored are saved by default in FirstCursor.txt,  
  -  Which can then be loaded. However, this may not work in all environments.  
  -  If you are concerned, please do not use this feature and backup the registry keys separately!  
- **10 New main menu messages are added!**  
  - Now, there are currently about 20 different messages!  
- Dark gray background is added in Default Boot animation  
- Reboot/Shutdown messages are added!  

#### Changed : 
- **Error handler argument is changed from `BatBootErrorHandlerArgument1908` into `BatBootErrorHandlerArgument1908␍␊`!**  
  - This means Newline characters are now included directly into Error Handler argument!  
  - I believe there is no way to enter this character in cmd other than to copy and paste it directly. This further improves the stability of the Error handler!  
- **Recovery menu CUI code is improved!**  
  - The `for` statement loop used in the Setting Menu CUI is now also used in the Recovery Menu CUI!  
  - This allows for much faster move. In the future, I'm planing to implement this method in other CUI Code  
- **Smoother transtion with overlay And better Overlay Code!**  
  - This allows the background to darken without flickering. This can be seen, for example, in the `Exit menu` and `Version info`!  
- **BSOD color is changed to darker color!**  
  - `#080884` to `#003D92`!  
  - (`3003D92` is actually same as windows 11's BSOD Color!)  
- Change log Code is bit improved  
  - *The Github API, which used to be used twice, is now combined into a single API use  
- Mainmenu Messages logic is bit improved  
- `:batshutdown` is renamed with `:Powerscreen`!  
- Minor improvement in Setting CUI code  
  - *Syntax fixes*  
- All `start chrome.exe` is replaced with `start (URL)...`  

#### Fixed : 
- **Main menu background's halloween theme is fixed!**  
  - After 1.15β2, the colors were a little darker than in 1.14c and not correct, but this has been fixed and the colors are now correct!  
- Minor bug fixes  
- Minor code fixes  

> This update will be the last update for this year.  
> The cursor backup feature has not been well tested for different registry key configurations or for registry values containing special characters.  
> What has been tested is under the standard Windows cursor environment.  
> If you are concern about it, don't use it.  
> If you find a bug or a glitch, please report it in an issue.
